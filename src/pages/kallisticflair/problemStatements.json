      "details": "As technology advances, organizations are increasingly at risk of sophisticated cyber threats that can compromise sensitive data, disrupt operations, and damage their reputation. The traditional approach to cybersecurity, which relies heavily on predefined rule sets and signature-based detection, struggles to keep up with the constantly evolving threat landscape. These conventional methods often fail to detect zero-day vulnerabilities and advanced persistent threats (APTs)."
